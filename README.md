Use the package manager pip3 before running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
In order to run the program, you must download the password dump, and place it in src/resources. The password dump can be downloaded from below if you aren't on linux; otherwise ```rockyou.sh``` is included for convenience:

```bash
http://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou.txt.bz2
